# python-challenge
Two different data sets were analyzed for this challenge. The first, PyBank, looked at a companies profit/loss sheet over 86 months, and Python was used to determine the net total profit/loss, the average monthly change, and the months with the greatest increase/decrease. The second data set, PyPoll, looked at election data for a small rural town. I used Python to determine the total number of votes, the candidates that received votes, how many they received (count and percentage), and the winner of the elction. I used the provided csv data sets, and I output my analysis into a csv file.
